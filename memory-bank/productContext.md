# Product Context - Why 3DS Mock Server Exists

## Problems This Project Solves

### 1. Development Testing Bottleneck
**Problem:** Real 3DS authentication requires live bank connections, creating development friction
**Solution:** Complete mock server enabling isolated testing without external dependencies

### 2. Learning Curve for 3DS Protocol
**Problem:** 3DS specification is complex, making it hard for developers to understand the flow
**Solution:** Working implementation with clear documentation showing each step

### 3. Integration Testing Complexity  
**Problem:** Testing payment flows requires coordinating multiple external services
**Solution:** Self-contained mock server that can be controlled for predictable test scenarios

### 4. Rust Web Development Education Gap
**Problem:** Limited real-world examples of Rust web servers with proper patterns
**Solution:** Production-quality example demonstrating best practices from basics to advanced

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals

#### For Developers
- **Simple Setup:** `cargo run` starts a working server
- **Clear Testing:** Postman collection works immediately  
- **Predictable Behavior:** Same input always produces same output
- **Educational Value:** Code structure teaches Rust and web development

#### For Payment Teams
- **Protocol Accuracy:** Responses match real 3DS server behavior
- **Flow Completeness:** All transaction states represented
- **Integration Ready:** Drop-in replacement for development environments

#### For Learners
- **Progressive Complexity:** Start simple, build understanding gradually
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Every concept explained clearly
- **Real-World Patterns:** Techniques applicable beyond this project

### Target Workflows

#### Development Workflow
1. **Start Server:** Developer runs `cargo run`
2. **Test Integration:** Application makes 3DS calls to localhost:8080
3. **Verify Behavior:** Predictable responses enable automated testing
4. **Debug Issues:** Clear error messages and logging

#### Learning Workflow  
1. **Read Documentation:** Start with beginner-friendly explanations
2. **Explore Code:** Understand structure through documented examples
3. **Modify Behavior:** Change business logic to test understanding
4. **Extend Features:** Add new functionality using established patterns

#### Testing Workflow
1. **Challenge Flow:** Use card ending in 4001 for full authentication
2. **Frictionless Flow:** Use card ending in 4000 for simplified path
3. **Error Scenarios:** Test with invalid transaction IDs
4. **State Verification:** Confirm data persistence across API calls
