# Active Context - Current Work Focus & Recent Changes

## Current Work Focus

### Project Journey - Platform-Specific SDK Reference Numbers Implementation (Latest)
ðŸŽ¯ **Latest Task:** Implement platform-specific SDK reference numbers to support both Android and iOS flows
âœ… **Delivered:** Complete platform-specific ECDH key derivation with automatic platform detection and proper SDK reference numbers

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Issue:** Android flow stopped working after iOS support was added
- **Cause:** Single SDK reference number `"3DS_LOA_SDK_JTPL_020200_00805"` was used for both platforms
- **Evidence:** Android SDK expected `"3DS_LOA_SDK_JTPL_020200_00788"` while iOS needed `"3DS_LOA_SDK_JTPL_020200_00805"`
- **Impact:** ECDH key derivation produced incorrect keys for Android, causing decryption failures

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Platform-Specific SDK Reference Numbers**: Android uses `"00788"`, iOS uses `"00805"`
- **Automatic Platform Detection**: Based on JWE header `enc` field (`A128CBC-HS256` = Android, `A128GCM` = iOS)
- **Updated Function Signature**: Added platform parameter to `calculate_derived_key`
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Both Android and iOS round-trip tests pass
- **Enhanced Logging**: Platform detection and SDK reference number usage clearly logged

**Key Learning:**
- Platform-specific parameters in cryptographic protocols require careful handling
- Automatic detection based on protocol headers provides seamless user experience
- ECDH key derivation is sensitive to all input parameters, including SDK reference numbers
- Cross-platform compatibility requires platform-aware implementations

**Technical Changes Made:**
- **Updated `calculate_derived_key` function**: Added platform parameter for conditional SDK reference number selection
- **Enhanced `challenge_handler`**: Added automatic platform detection from JWE header
- **Fixed all function calls**: Updated throughout codebase including tests
- **Platform-specific logging**: Added clear indicators of detected platform and chosen SDK reference number
- **Maintained backward compatibility**: Legacy functions available for existing code

**Implementation Details:**
```rust
// Platform-specific SDK reference numbers
let sdk_reference_number = match platform.to_lowercase().as_str() {
    "android" => "3DS_LOA_SDK_JTPL_020200_00788",
    "ios" => "3DS_LOA_SDK_JTPL_020200_00805",
    _ => return Err("Unsupported platform".into()),
};

// Automatic platform detection in challenge_handler
let platform = match header_json["enc"].as_str().unwrap_or("unknown") {
    "A128CBC-HS256" => "android",
    "A128GCM" => "ios",
    _ => // error handling
};
```

**Impact:**
- **Android Support Restored**: Uses correct SDK reference number for ECDH key derivation
- **iOS Support Maintained**: Continues to work with iOS-specific reference number  
- **Seamless Detection**: No manual configuration needed, automatically detects platform
- **Future Extensible**: Easy to add support for additional platforms
- **Clear Debugging**: Enhanced logging shows platform detection and key derivation process

### Previous Project Journey - Redis TTL Configuration Fix
ðŸŽ¯ **Previous Task:** Investigate and fix "Transaction not found" errors in web flow
âœ… **Delivered:** Identified Redis TTL expiration issue and increased TTL from 5 minutes to 20 minutes for development

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Issue:** "Transaction not found for ID: 938e11ff-6f46-47f3-a554-3436be73819a" errors in web flow
- **Cause:** Redis TTL too short (300 seconds/5 minutes) for realistic user workflows
- **Evidence:** 16-minute gap between authentication (09:58:11) and OTP verification (10:14:23) in logs
- **Impact:** Transactions expiring before users complete authentication flow

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Configuration Update:** Increased development TTL from 300 to 1200 seconds (20 minutes)
- **Enhanced Logging:** Added transaction storage logging with TTL values for debugging
- **Production Ready:** Production already had appropriate 1800 seconds (30 minutes) TTL
- **User Experience:** More realistic timing for manual testing and actual user workflows

**Key Learning:**
- Redis TTL must accommodate realistic user behavior (finding OTP, switching apps, network delays)
- Short TTLs appropriate for automated tests but not manual/user testing
- Transaction timing is critical in 3DS flows due to multi-step authentication process
- Logging TTL values aids in debugging timeout-related issues

**Technical Changes Made:**
- Updated `config/development.toml`: `ttl_seconds = 1200` (was 300)
- Enhanced `src/state_store.rs`: Added transaction storage logging with TTL visibility
- Maintained production configuration: Already at appropriate 1800 seconds

### Previous Project Journey - sdkTransId Mobile Flow Requirement
ðŸŽ¯ **Previous Task:** Make sdkTransId required only for mobile flows (deviceChannel="01") in the /3ds/authenticate path
âœ… **Delivered:** Updated validation to enforce sdkTransId presence for mobile flows while making it optional for browser flows

**New Implementation:**
- **Optional sdkTransId Parameter**: Updated all models to use `Option<Uuid>` for the sdkTransId field
- **Flow-Specific Validation**: Added validation to ensure sdkTransId is present for mobile deviceChannel="01"
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Returns clear error message when sdkTransId is missing for mobile flows
- **Optional Field Handling**: Updated code to properly handle optional sdkTransId throughout the codebase

**Changes Made:**
- **Updated Model Structs**: Changed `sdk_trans_id` from `Uuid` to `Option<Uuid>` in:
  - `AuthenticateRequest` in models.rs
  - `ResultsRequest` in models.rs
  - `ResultsResponse` in models.rs
  - `TransactionData` in state_store.rs
- **Enhanced Validation**: Added explicit check in authenticate_handler:
  ```rust
  if is_mobile && sdk_trans_id.is_none() {
      error!("Missing sdk_trans_id for mobile flow (deviceChannel=01)");
      return Ok(HttpResponse::BadRequest().json(serde_json::json!({
          "error": "sdkTransId is required for mobile flows (deviceChannel=01)"
      })));
  }
  ```
- **Fixed String Formatting**: Updated all string formatting for the optional type using `map_or_else()`
- **Consistent Authentication Response**: Updated response creation to handle optional sdkTransId

**Implementation Details:**
- Mobile flows (deviceChannel="01") now require sdkTransId field in the request
- Browser flows (deviceChannel="02") can omit sdkTransId field entirely
- Error response provides clear indication when field is missing for mobile flow
- All user-facing output formats UUID correctly for both cases

**Specifications Followed:**
- Aligns with EMVCo 3DS 2.0 specification where sdkTransId is only applicable for mobile SDK-based flows
- Maintains backwards compatibility with existing implementations
- Follows REST API best practices for optional vs. required fields
- Provides clear, actionable error messages

**Impact:**
- More flexible API for browser-based integrations (no unnecessary fields)
- Stricter validation for mobile SDK flows ensuring proper transaction tracking
- Clearer contract for API consumers about requirements by flow type
- Reduced validation errors by making requirements explicit and flow-dependent

- **Updated `encrypt_challenge_response`**: Fixed HMAC generation to match JWE specification
- **Parameter Renaming**: Changed `jwe_data` to `jwe_string` and `derived_key` to `derived_key_buffer`
- **Console Logging**: Updated logging format to match JavaScript implementation

**Implementation Details:**
- Corrected HMAC input to follow the JWE specification: `AAD || IV || Ciphertext || AAD Length`
- AAD (Additional Authenticated Data) is the base64url-encoded JWE Protected Header
- AAD Length is a 64-bit big-endian integer representing the bit length of AAD
- Raw bytes are used for IV and Ciphertext in the HMAC calculation (not base64-encoded)
- Truncated HMAC to first 16 bytes for the authentication tag as specified in JWE spec

**Fixed Issues:**
1. **"HMAC verification failed" Error**: 
   - Previous implementation incorrectly calculated HMAC over compact serialization format with dots
   - Updated to calculate HMAC according to JWE specification
   - Fixed key handling to ensure consistency with jose library

2. **JavaScript Compatibility**:
   - Ensured Rust implementation matches Node.js jose library behavior
